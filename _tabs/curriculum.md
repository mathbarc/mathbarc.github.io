Hello! 

I am a Brazillian Computer Engineer from Minas Gerais and I started this blog to log some experiments and researches I am doing. It works more as a catalog of projects and tutorials that I do to help some friends into those subjects but I would love to get some [feedback](mailto://matheusbarcelosoliveira@gmail.com) on the material. 

Hope you find the posts useful!
